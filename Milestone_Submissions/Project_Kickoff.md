4. Project Name - ThreadBlend
5. Application Description: Our project is going to be broken down into phases. The primary goal will be getting to the MVP stage, but some additional functionality is also listed. At minimum, our project will provide a front-end web app that can display chat threads from different sources. Main intended sources include 3rd party chats apps (Messenger, Instagram, whatsApp) and productivity tools (ChatGPT, GoogleWorkspace, Teams).  For both, the user will be able to see and respond to messages using an simple chat box. Account management tools, like Sign Up, Log In, and 3rd Party Account Linking will also be implemented in the front end. The back end will be implemented to accept connections from multiple users at a time and feature a RESTful API that will handle requests sent from the users and provide the appropriate responses. Categories for API calls can mainly be divided into, account creation and management for our users, interfacing with the 3rd Party APIs, and managing the credentials for those APIs. Finally, a database will be implemented to store user info and login credentials. Some user chat info may need to be stored in the database as a "cache" of sorts but that remains to be seen. At minimum, our product will be able to do all of these things for at least 2 3rd party apps. This will act as a sort of proof of concept that multiple chat apps can be combined into one and allow users to have one place to go for everything. Once base functionality has been met, we would like to add additional features like: support for more 3rd party apps, implementation of security best practices for storing user information in our databases, and the ability to have chat threads native to the app itself. It is beyond the scope of this course, but eventually mobile apps would need be developed as the main platform for this project.
6. Vision Statement:
   - For those who communicate through several different chat platforms who want to be able to access all their conversation from one place. ThreadBlend is a unified messaging app that. Our product provides additional functionality by interfacing with prodictivity tools as well - all from the same app.
